# Project Description

This project demonstrates how to build an **LLM (Large Language Model) Chat Application** using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **Ollama.py**. The application serves as an interactive interface for conversational AI, leveraging powerful LLM capabilities to provide intelligent, context-aware responses in real-time.

The video tutorial ([LLM Chat App in Python](https://decoder.sh/videos/llm-chat-app-in-python-w_-ollama_py-and-streamlit)) provides a step-by-step guide to creating this project, focusing on integrating Ollama's LLM API with a user-friendly frontend built with Streamlit.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Chat Interface**: A dynamic chat interface where users can interact with the AI.  
- **LLM Integration**: Utilizes Ollama's robust LLM for conversational capabilities.  
- **Streamlit UI**: Streamlined and intuitive user experience powered by Streamlit.  
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different use cases such as customer support, education, or personal assistants.  

This project is ideal for anyone looking to explore conversational AI, learn about LLM integration, or build scalable chat applications with Python.
